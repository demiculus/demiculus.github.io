## How to Actually Stand Out When Applying

Hey, we get a lot of messages like  
- “here’s my experience"  
- "let me know if you have time for a call”   
- "here are 2 pages of ideas"  

These efforts show hustle — and that’s a great starting point. But hustle alone doesn’t guarantee you’ll stand out. This post is meant to help you understand and increase your effectiveness for next job applications.

### Common Pitfalls

❌ Listing achievements with no context  
❌ Pitching generic skills  
❌ Sending a list of ideas  
❌ Explaining why you’re a good fit  
❌ Requesting a call  
❌ Sending CV  

### What does stand out?

1. Doing research, identify real pain points, and show initiative to address them  
2. Thinking before speaking, and focus on us, not them  
3. Being [problem oriented](https://medium.com/@vaishnavipandey2901/problem-first-mindset-what-why-its-important-48c940ef923d) instead of solution oriented  
4. Ability to write pages worth of value in a single sentence  

Reaching out directly can absolutely be smart — when it’s done with understanding and intent. That’s the key. This post isn’t to discourage reaching out, but to help you do it in a way that’s genuinely effective.  

I hope this helps.  
Your effort is noticed — this is just about leveling it up.

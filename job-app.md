## How to Actually Stand Out When Applying

Hey, I get a lot of messages like  
- “here’s my experience"  
- "let me know if you have time for a call”   

Appreciate the hustle — but if you're reading this you failed at standing out.  

Why most messages fail:  

❌ Listing past achievements → ✅ Understanding our actual problems  
❌ Pitching skills in a vacuum → ✅ Asking smart questions  
❌ Requesting a call → ✅ Showing initiative and insight  
❌ Explaining why you're a good fit → ✅ Demonstrating how you'd help  

### TL;DR
Don’t sell yourself. Solve something. Be curious. Be specific. That’s how to stand out.  

Thanks for reading. Hope this helps!

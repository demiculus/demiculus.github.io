title: Chaos vs Clarity
---

## What is Chaos?

It is creating destructure. A way to understand if something is chaotic is if it creates anxiousness feeling.

## What is Clarity?

It is creating structure. A way to understand if something is clear is if it creates harmony or excitement feelings.

## Rating

We rank both Chaos and Clarity from 0 to 10

If a junior has a Chaos rating of 4 a senior needs to spend 4 of their Clarity points on the juniors work just to keep it managable. The senior could have spent that 4 Clarity point on something else but they're spending it on the junior.

If the organization has a chaos rating more than clarity rating the organization will head towards negative productivity eventually collapsing on itself.

## Developer Example

A developer creating messy code. The senior will have a harder time going through the code, spend more time asking the junior to clean up.

## Designer Example

A designer submitting 20 ideas placed randomly in a figma file. The reviewer needs to spend a lot of time going through it trying to nitpick the essense of the submission.

## Other Examples

Someone coming up with 100 ideas and wanting to do them all. Because 100 ideas were thrown into the discussion now its going to take others a lot longer to understand them and then eventually filter them. Wheres the ideator could have done the filtering and submitted just one idea and their filtering algorithm.

## Ideal Scenario

At Colonist.io we want everyone to be creating more Clarity than Chaos. There are many mental models that could be used to decrease the Chaos and increase the Clarity. I will list a few here

1. Using these communication frameworks https://demiculus.com/communication/
2. Before submitting something, throughly reviewing it maybe triple checking it
3. Clarifying thoughts before communicating
  - Dumping thoughts for a few pages until it becomes clear
  - Taking a 30 minute hot shower or 30 minute walk while contemplating the idea
4. Sleeping on top of it and looking at it with fresh eyes

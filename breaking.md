# Breaking

### Windmill

Things to keep in mind while doing windmill

- Keep legs open & in the air
- Don't remove elbow from hip
- While starting the second round thrust right leg

(Jan19) Figured out how to do keep my legs up (by being more at the top of my back) but couldn’t do seamlessly yet

### Flare

(Jan 19) First time did 50 flares in 1 day
(Jan 20) Even if my legs hit the ground, don’t stop the move and continue to move.

### Swipe

(Jan 12 2019) TIL how arms should be on swipes, one should leave the ground before the other touches

### 1990 

- While entering the move press your hand from your shoulder and lift up you ass to handstand position
- When placing second hand move your head near your second hand

(Jan 19 2019) First time able to lift my bottom/legs up vertical to my shoulders

### Baby Freeze 

(Jan 07 2019) TIL the reason I wasn't able to do baby freze was lack of flexibility and after some buttocks stretching I was easily able to do baby freze. 

### Scorpion

(Jan 12) First time my butt touches the wall on scorpion

### General

(Jan 12) First time my hands touch each other on my back while flexing like this but with the help of someone else

### TODO

- I like prayer squats (for hip mobility)

- I like squats with knee drops (for hip mobility)

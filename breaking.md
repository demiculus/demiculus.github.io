# Breaking

### Windmill

19 Jan 2019 - Figured out how to do keep my legs up (by being more at the top of my back) but couldn’t do seamlessly yet

### Flare

19 Jan 2019 - First time did 50 flares in 1 day

20 Jan 2019 - Even if my legs hit the ground, don’t stop the move and continue to move

23 Jan 2019 - Easily do 1 flare outside of practice

### Swipe

12 Jan 2019 - TIL how arms should be on swipes, one should leave the ground before the other touches

### 1990 

11 Jan 2019 - TIL while entering the move press your hand from your shoulder and lift up you ass to handstand position

11 Jan 2019 - TIL when placing second hand move your head near your second hand

19 Jan 2019 - First time able to lift my bottom/legs up vertical to my shoulders

23 Jan 2019 - First time able to spin 180 degrees. 

### Baby Freeze 

7 Jan 2019 - TIL the reason I wasn't able to do baby freze was lack of flexibility and after some buttocks stretching I was easily able to do baby freze.

23 Jan 2019 - No longer need to stretch my buttocks before attempting, my daily stretches have made me more flexible.

23 Jan 2019 - Able to easily get to baby position from the ground. But flexibility still doesn't let me do it from a normal point.

25 Jan 2019 - Able to get to freeze position without starting from ground. I lift my back leg and thrust my forward one. So it wasn't the flexibilty afterall.

### Chair Freeze

23 Jan 2019 - First time able to touch foot to ground on right side.

### Scorpion

12 Jan 2019 - First time my butt touches the wall on scorpion

### Handstand

25 Jan 2019 - First time walking backwards (max 6 steps at a time)

### General

12 Jan 2019 - First time my hands touch each other on my back while flexing like this but with the help of someone else

# Breaking

### Windmill

19 Jan 2019 - Figured out how to do keep my legs up (by being more at the top of my back) but couldn’t do seamlessly yet

26 Jan 2019 - I think I figured it out this time, when I'm on my back and trying to get to turtle position I need to push my hand while not lifting my legs above toward my head.

26 Jan 2019 - I am not failing/trying enough because my shoulder hurts. I need to find a way to prevent it.

11 Feb 2019 - While On your back I'm taking too much time, I need to improve my speed, and also bring my legs closer towards my head. (Thanks Halil)

11 Feb 2019 - I think ive finally figure out consistantly how not to hit my shoulder, but my knowledge is not technical more of a feeling. I try to tense my left arm/shoulder, keep my left arm close to my shoulder while going down. Also i try to land on the accumilated fat/muscle which is between my arm and shoulder. Which means im landing lower in my back rather than at the top where i hit my shoulder

### Flare

19 Jan 2019 - First time did 50 flares in 1 day

20 Jan 2019 - Even if my legs hit the ground, don’t stop the move and continue to move

23 Jan 2019 - Easily do 1 flare outside of practice

26 Jan 2019 - I need to put my second hand nearer to my body

Feb 8 2019 - First time 2 rounds (form and everything messed up, feet touching the ground)

Feb 9 2019 - First time 5+ rounds (form and everything messed up, feet touch the ground)

Feb 11 2019 - I thought I was holding my left leg in the air but actually I wasnt. After trying to hold it in the air, I felt it for the first time how it should have been. (Thanks Halil)

### Swipe

12 Jan 2019 - TIL how arms should be on swipes, one should leave the ground before the other touches

3 Feb 2019 - Start by facing the side not by facing up

### 1990 

11 Jan 2019 - TIL while entering the move press your hand from your shoulder and lift up you ass to handstand position

11 Jan 2019 - TIL when placing second hand move your head near your second hand

19 Jan 2019 - First time able to lift my bottom/legs up vertical to my shoulders

23 Jan 2019 - First time able to spin 180 degrees. 

26 Jan 2019 - Don't forget to move head closer to second arm

26 Jan 2019 - TIL that while entering the move I swirl my second hand behind me where I shouldnt be swirling it back like that

3 Feb 2019 - Today I felt that the rotation is controlled by the right leg

9 Feb 2019 - Prerequisite is getting  butt in the air, prerequisite of that is getting butt in air on handstand, prerequisite of that is shoulder flexibility. I need to flex my shoulders and at least make them touch the ground when I'm on my back

11 Feb 2019 - Landing the entry is important, the thing that matters most is being able to balance on your turning hand as much as possible. (Thanks Halil)

### Baby Freeze 

7 Jan 2019 - TIL the reason I wasn't able to do baby freze was lack of flexibility and after some buttocks stretching I was easily able to do baby freze.

23 Jan 2019 - No longer need to stretch my buttocks before attempting, my daily stretches have made me more flexible.

23 Jan 2019 - Able to easily get to baby position from the ground. But flexibility still doesn't let me do it from a normal point.

25 Jan 2019 - Able to get to freeze position without starting from ground. I lift my back leg and thrust my forward one. So it wasn't the flexibilty afterall.

### Chair Freeze

23 Jan 2019 - First time able to touch foot to ground on right side.

6 Feb 2019 - Right hand chair both toes touch the ground for the first time (wow I thought this was my first)

### Scorpion

12 Jan 2019 - First time my butt touches the wall on scorpion

### Handstand

25 Jan 2019 - First time walking backwards max 6 steps at a time, usually 2

6 Feb 2019 - Walked backwards 8 steps for the first time

11 Feb 2019 - Started doing sideway walks & first time I was able to walk 4 steps to the side

### Toprock - Style

26 Jan 2019 - Dancing with a chrunch position (knees 30%) looks better

26 Jan 2019 - Only using legs doesn't look so good, always add arms

### General

12 Jan 2019 - First time my hands touch each other on my back while flexing like this but with the help of someone else

30 Jan 2019 - Wrists hurt so bad that can't focus on practice. TIL that I need to strengten & increase flexibility of my wrists

1 Feb 2019 - Wrists hurt but not as bad. Wrist training exercises seem to be working.

### TODO

- I like prayer squats (for hip mobility)

# Breaking

### Windmill

Things to keep in mind while doing windmill

- Keep legs open & in the air
- Don't remove elbow from hip
- While starting the second round thrust right leg

19 Jan 2019 - Figured out how to do keep my legs up (by being more at the top of my back) but couldn’t do seamlessly yet

### Flare

19 Jan 2019 - First time did 50 flares in 1 day

20 Jan 2019 - Even if my legs hit the ground, don’t stop the move and continue to move.

### Swipe

12 Jan 2019 - TIL how arms should be on swipes, one should leave the ground before the other touches

### 1990 

11 Jan 2019 - TIL while entering the move press your hand from your shoulder and lift up you ass to handstand position

11 Jan 2019 - TIL when placing second hand move your head near your second hand

19 Jan 2019 - First time able to lift my bottom/legs up vertical to my shoulders

### Baby Freeze 

7 Jan 2019 - TIL the reason I wasn't able to do baby freze was lack of flexibility and after some buttocks stretching I was easily able to do baby freze. 

### Scorpion

12 Jan 2019 - First time my butt touches the wall on scorpion

### General

12 Jan 2019 - First time my hands touch each other on my back while flexing like this but with the help of someone else

### TODO

- I like prayer squats (for hip mobility)

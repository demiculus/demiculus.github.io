## AI Usage

I've seen many people use AI, get wrong answers and execute the wrong answers. AI is not god. AI is mediocre. Once you understand that then you can craft the AI that is not mediocre and get the right answers.


### Popular Method
You are the worlds best ..... 
Give me ....

This returns above average mediocracy but still has a chance to ruin your life.

You are the worlds best psychologist
Give me ..
The solution is more likely to make you depressed rather than help you.

### Updated Method
Give me ....
According to
B.F. Skinner vs Sigmund Freud vs Carl Jung

1 of the 3 will send you down a depression spiral. But since you're asking all 3 you'll have the option to choose.


## Examples

### Example - Gifts
❌ How can I build a startup?

✅ How can I build a startup according to  
- Zero to One  
- The Lean Startup  
- Hard things about hard things  
- Hooked: How to Build Habit‑Forming  

### Example - Productivity
❌ How can I be more productive?  

✅ How can I be more productive according to Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos  

### Figuring Out Top Content

If you don't know what to refer to, ask the AI top 
- books  
- people  
- values  
- blogs  
- etc..  
  
✅ What are the top startup books?

And then your second prompt should be whatever you're looking for.   

Unless specific content is referred your AI output is MEDIOCRE and possible wrong.

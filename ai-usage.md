If you don't know what to refer to, ask the AI top 
- books
- people
- values
- blogs
- etc..
  
> What are the top blogs about finding the perfect gift for spouse?

And then your second prompt should be whatever you're looking for. 
Unless you select the right content, you might get the wrong advice.

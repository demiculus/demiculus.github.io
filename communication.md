## TLDR

- Your proposal should be instantly graspable within 5 seconds.
- Your writing should be so clear that it doesn't require re-reading.

There are 3 strong tools to do this.

## Dilbert Principle

Read the [dilbert principle](https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html).

### Example:

❌ "At this point in time, we are in need of assistance."  

Using dilbert principle we can remove stuff until only the essence is left  

✅ "We need help now."  

## Pyramid Principle

Read the [Pyramid Principle](https://medium.com/lessons-from-mckinsey/the-pyramid-principle-f0885dd3c5c7)

### Example 1:
> Wife: When will you be back?  
> ❌ Husband: I will go to the grocery, pick up stuff, then pick up the kids, then go to barber and after a round trip, I'll probably be home at 6pm.  

Instead start with the answer and if wife asks the details answer them.  

> ✅ Husband: I'll be home at 6pm.

### Example 2:
> ❌ Here is my report, I went through all the social medias, all the platforms, all the things. I dove deeper into stuff. I gathered more information from google. I also did bla bla bla

The listeners has zoned out already. Instead start with the result and the listeners will ask more questions if interested.

> ✅ Lets go with strategy A. It will increase retention by X, revenue by Y. More details below

This way it is clear what is being presented.

## Double Speak
Doublespeak is language that deliberately obscures, disguises, or distorts meaning. Here are four common types:  

### Euphemism
Uses mild or vague terms to soften harsh realities 

❌ "downsizing"  
✅ "firing employees")  

### Jargon
Uses technical or specialized language to confuse or exclude outsiders 

❌ "negative patient outcome"  
✅ "death"  

### Gobbledygook (Bureaucratese)
Overcomplicates language with excessive words or convoluted structure to obscure meaning 

❌ "collateral damage"  
✅ "civilian casualties"  

### Inflated Language
Makes simple things sound grander or more important than they are

❌ "sanitation engineer"  
✅ "janitor"

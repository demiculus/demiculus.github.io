## TLDR

- Your proposal should be instantly graspable within 5 seconds.
- Your writing should be so clear that it doesn't require re-reading.

There are 2 strong tools to do this.

## Dilbert Principle

Read the [dilbert principle](https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html).

### Example:
> Hey Demi, I hope everything is going well. I wanted to ask you a question. Should I choose the option A which is creative or option B which is pragmatic?

Using dilbert principle we can remove stuff until only the essence is left

> Hey Demi, should I move forward with option A or B?

## Pyramid Principle

Read the [Pyramid Principle](https://medium.com/lessons-from-mckinsey/the-pyramid-principle-f0885dd3c5c7)

### Example 1:
> Wife: When will you be back?  
> Husband: I will go to the grocery, pick up stuff, then pick up the kids, then go to barber and after a round trip, I'll probably be home at 6pm.

Instead start with the answer and if wife asks the details answer them.

> Husband: I'll be home at 6pm.

### Example 2:
> Here is my report, I went through all the social medias, all the platforms, all the things. I dove deeper into stuff. I gathered more information from google. I also did bla bla bla

The listeners has zoned out already. Instead start with the result and the listeners will ask more questions if interested.

> Lets go with strategy A. 
> A will increase retention by X, revenue by Y
> More details below

This way it is clear what is being presented.

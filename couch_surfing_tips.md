# Couch Surfing Tips

When contacting somebody make sure you have a trustworthy profile. Couch surfing is about trust. People do not host random strangers in their house. Each profile has an abstract trust rating. Each host wants a certain level of trust in a profile to host them. People who have hosted many travellers tend to host profiles with lesser trust rating than people who haven't. 

Here are some tips on how you can improve your trust rating hence get easier hosting.

### 1. Photos

Have at least 7 photos. Make sure 2-3 of them are with your friends. 

### 2. About

Fill in your about section. Write at least 250 words.

### 3. References

Have references CS is a trust network. Ask your friends for references. I'm pretty sure you have many friends already signed up & use CS. If not get your 5 closest friends to sign up and give your reference. This is what I did when I first started using CS. I got 7 of my friends to give me references: https://www.couchsurfing.com/people/demiculus hence it was easier for me to couchsurf.

If you don't have 5 close friends whom you can ask for reference, you need to recheck your social life and where you went wrong. Fix it before going traveling.

Another way is to attend CS meetups and meet with CS people. Become friends and ask them for references. 

### 4. Social Media

Make sure to post your social media accounts. The more accounts & history you have the more trust rating you will have. Its okay if you don't have Instagram/Twitter/Pinterest/Github you can write that you don't have them and the reason in your profile. 

### 5. Verification

This isn't as important as other ones but have as much of these verified as you can. Phone & Government ID is easier, payment is not necessary since most surfers might not have the money for it.

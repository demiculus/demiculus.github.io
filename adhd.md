## Adhd

While there are many different Adhd types and I don't resonate with many of the things, I've listed things I resonate with. This document is for you to understand me better. I hope you enjoy such interactions. And for those you don't, I'm sorry for putting you through it.


### Out of sight, out of mind

I literally forget things out of my sight. This includes drinking water, eating food, responding to texts, items left in other rooms as well as missing people.

I've systemized my life so that I always remember things I should be doing. Ofc sometimes I put my glass in the wrong place and forget drinking water for a day.

### Being Annoying

I'm trying really hard to not be annoying. But everything in my body is pushing me to be annoying. It's a battle I face in every single social setting.

### Can't Get Up And Do Stuff

I want to do so much stuff. But I sometimes can't. Adhd is not an excuse, I should be expected to get stuff done. It's okay to whip me for it.

### Boring Conversations

Don't give me boring mediocratiy conversations.

### Can't Listen At Slow Speed

My mind gets distractd when I am **only** listening. But if I'm doing something physical while listening I'm able to do it.

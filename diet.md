## TLDR

Kids should eat lots of protein & minerals to form proper skeletal structure. 

## Nutrition Deficiency

### Height
[Nutrition deficiencies can reduce the height of a person by 15%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525242/). This means that If a deficient 1.60cm male grew up with proper nutrition they would have become 1.85cm. 

- Netherlands average male height
  - 1875: 165cm
  - 2023: 184cm

- [Korean average male height](https://www.creatrip.com/en/blog/10181)
  - 1914: 159.8cm
  - 2014: 174.9cm
- Korean average female height
  - 1914: 142.2cm
  - 2014: 162.3cm

The main reason of these jumps are eating properly.

### Other Problems

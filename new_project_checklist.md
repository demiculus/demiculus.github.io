# New Project Checklist

### Questions to ask oneself:

- Why do you want to start this project? (the answer to this question should be emotional not logical)
- What is the goal?
- Can this goal be achieved in another way more easily?
- Is this fun?
- Is this something you can do uniquely?
- Can you make this happen effortlessly?
- Is this something you wish someone else would build for you?
- Will you be able to see growth of your progress everyweek and get feedback?
- Are you continuing to work on this because of sunk cost?
- Does anyone have a doubt about this project?
  - If so don't start the project until the doubt is settled.
- Is this project in the green box as in Demi's red/yellow/green box algorithm?
  - If it is in the yellow box, what would it take to move it to red or green?
- Does this project pass the frequency/intensity test? (Users have this problem very frequently or/and users have this problem intensely)
- How easy is it for you to reach users?
- Give it points in [project utility assesment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17D8YyYGm94tBt5lFE8TDDtPfXLCFKxDXroBr-iJ6JV4/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=110291342688342715176)
- Do [Coinbase Decision Making Framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xYCr46GeyeZ-JJMyxWRM0sb-1DI3lqNGwQ5iBxKCOqA/edit#gid=0) [source](https://medium.com/@barmstrong/how-we-make-decisions-at-coinbase-cd6c630322e9)

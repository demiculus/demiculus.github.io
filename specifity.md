## Specifity

When I am having an interview or trying to understand something it does not help speaking in generals. The more specific and concrete a person can get the more they will be able to deliver the message across. 

A good gauge if a sentence is clear or not is this. How many types of that thing might exist? Does the listener have a concrete picture of whats being explained or does the listener have an array of possibilities? 

### Example of Workplace

I work at a company -> There are a billion of those  
I work at a game company -> There are 100 thousand  
I work at online game company -> There are 50 thousand  
I work at online board game company -> There are 1000  
I work at online Catan company -> There are 5  
I work at Colonist.io -> There is 1  

The more specific the person goes the more clear they deliver the message.

### Example of Experience

I managed a pipeline of automation systems -> Could be a million things  
I managed automation pipelines for software deployments -> Could be 100k things  
I managed CI/CD automation pipelines for a web-based gaming platform. -> Could be 1000 things  
I managed GitHub Actions and Docker-based CI/CD pipelines for deploying updates to an online Catan-style game -> Could be 100 things  
I managed GitHub Actions workflows that automated builds, tests, and deployments of colonist.ioâ€™s online board game, reducing release times by 40%. -> Could be a 10 things  

### Who Uses Non Clear Language

Scammers -> They don't want you to understand the details so they keep everything at a high level
Liars -> Same reason as scammers
People who didn't do the job -> In interviews they will never go deep, they'll stay at high level to hide the fact that they don't understand their job
Bad communicators -> It's lack of skill that they need to work on

If a bad commnicator does not want to be lumped into the above 3 buckets they should work on increasing the specifity of their communication.

## Hidden Rules

Why does the smart girl in school end up with average results and the "weird kid" becomes a top achiever? 

- Smart girl follows written & verbal rules.  
- Weird kid tests out rules and discovers hidden rules.

Rules are made by humans and humans are imperfect creatures. Especially when it comes to laying down rules. 

We all know of phrases like

- I did everything you asked for, why are you breaking up with me?  
- I checked every single box, why am I not getting a raise?
- I studied everything the teacher assigned, yet I got a low score.

This is because they followed the written rules and missed the hidden rules. Most people who nail the hidden rules do it by chance. Some people who nail the hidden rules have figured out those hidden rules and accomplish them.

Most successful people know this and ask themselves the following questions, 

> What are the real rules of this game?  
> What written rules are actually wrong?  
> If there were 2 more rules, what would they be?  

Good luck on your journey.

## Hidden Rules

Why does the smart girl in school end up doing okay and the weird kid becomes a top achiever? 

- Smart girl follows written & verbal rules.  
- Weird kid tests out rules and discovers hidden rules.

Rules are made by humans and humans are non-perfect creatures. Especially when it comes to laying down rules. 

We all know of phrases like

- I did everything you asked for, why are you breaking up from me?  
- I checked every single box, why am I not getting a raise, instead she is?
- I studied everything the teacher asked for yet I got a low score.

The reason is they followed the written rules and missed the hidden rules. Most people who nail the hidden rules do it by chance. Some people who nail the hidden rules have figured out those hidden rules and accomplishes them.

All the top successful people know this and they ask themselves the following question, 

> What are the real rules of this game?  
> What written rules are actually wrong?  
> If there were 2 more rules, what would they by?  

Good luck on your journey. 

I hope you discover a few interesting rules. And if you do, please email me. I love hearing from you.
